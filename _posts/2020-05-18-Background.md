The background for this blog is a masters thesis <a href="pdf/NicholasBristow_Thesis_MeasuringResidentialBuildingDensity_2019.pdf" target="_blank">"Measuring residential building density at the scale of the urban block"</a> that I submitted in August 2019 as part of the [International Planning and Sustainable Urban Development MA](https://www.westminster.ac.uk/construction-management-and-urban-planning-courses/2020-21/september/full-time/international-planning-and-sustainable-development-ma) at the University of Westminter. It was also presented at the [Predicting neighborhood change using big data and machine learning: Implications for theory, methods, and practice](https://bids.berkeley.edu/events/predicting-neighborhood-change-using-big-data-and-machine-learning-part-1) symposium at UC Berkeley in January 2020.
